## 👋 About me

Hey! I'm **Luís Felipe**, a passionate and curious developer who enjoys building **modern, scalable, and well-structured applications**.

My main focus is on **frontend development**, especially with **React and React Native**, where I like to combine clean code with good UI/UX practices. At the same time, I'm actively expanding my skills into **backend and DevOps**, because I believe great developers understand the system as a whole not just the interface.

I'm constantly experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and learning how software behaves **under the hood**. I value readable code, good architecture, and solutions that make sense in the real world.
