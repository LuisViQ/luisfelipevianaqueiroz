## 👋 About me

Hey! I'm **Luís Felipe**, a passionate and curious developer who enjoys building **modern, scalable, and well-structured applications**.

My main focus is on **frontend development**, especially with **React and React Native**, where I like to combine clean code with good UI/UX practices. At the same time, I'm actively expanding my skills into **backend and DevOps**, because I believe great developers understand the system as a whole — not just the interface.

I'm constantly experimenting, breaking things (on purpose 😅), fixing them, and learning how software behaves **under the hood**. I value readable code, good architecture, and solutions that make sense in the real world.

## 🧠 What I believe in as a developer

- 📌 Clean, readable, and maintainable code  
- 📌 Understanding *why* things work, not just *how*  
- 📌 Continuous learning and hands-on experimentation  
- 📌 Balancing performance, usability, and simplicity  
- 📌 Building solutions that can grow without turning into chaos
